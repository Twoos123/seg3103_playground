# seg3103_playground

## Synopsis

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.

## License

A short snippet describing the license (MIT, Apache, etc.)

i am required to make a repo for testing java, python and elixir code in a Software Quality Assurance class at uOttawa, codenamed SEG3103, please fill in this
Copilot
Certainly! Hereâ€™s a filled-in README template for your SEG3103 Software Quality Assurance class project:

# SEG3103 Testing Suite

## Synopsis

This repository contains a comprehensive testing suite designed for validating Java, Python, and Elixir code. It aims to ensure the highest quality standards for software development projects. The suite is easily integrable with continuous integration systems and provides a robust foundation for test-driven development practices.

## Code Example

# Java code example
public class Calculator {
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

# Python code example
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# Elixir code example
defmodule Calculator do
  def add(a, b) do
    a + b
  end
end

## Motivation
The motivation behind creating this testing suite is to provide students and developers with a reliable tool for ensuring their code is error-free and adheres to the highest quality standards. This suite is part of the SEG3103 curriculum to instill best practices in software testing among future software engineers.

## Installation
To install the testing suite, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies for Java, Python, and Elixir.
