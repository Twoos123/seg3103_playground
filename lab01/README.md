# seg3103_playground

## Synopsis

This repository will hold my lab work for course SEG 3103 Software Quality Assurance. All contributions are made by Asad Ali.

## Code Example

assets: Holds screenshots from lab excercises.

newmath_ex: Contains a division function written in Elixir which requests a numerator and denominator from a user and then displays the result of a division operation. Ther are also files test files inculded to test the division function using ExUnit testing.
